## Description
This folder contains a tool for headless production programming of STM32F030 ICs with the Calliope GameKit firmware. It consists of 1 shell script and 1 service . The service runs an infinite-loop script, which executes the following steps: 
1. Wait for STM32F030 target detection via OpenOCD (target connection check)
2. Flash GameKit Firmware to STM32F030 using OpenOCD
3. Light up red PWR led when flashing is finished
4. Wait for tests to be done and disconnection of STM32F030

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (4)
- STLink-V3MINIE
- openocd V0.12 (e.g. xpack on arm64 https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases)
- udevrule (inside this repo)
- sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER


## Raspberry Pi Preparation Steps:
- install Raspberry Pi OS (64bit)
- get control of ACT led in /boot/config.txt by adding to the bottom:

dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off
dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=default-on
dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=off

- clone this repo
- copy service to systemd with sudo cp prodprog.service /lib/systemd/system/
- reload services with sudo systemctl daemon-reload
- enable service with sudo systemctl enable prodprog.service
- start service with sudo systemctl start prodprog.service

## Exchange firmware files: 
- replace GameKitF030C8.hex

## Hardware Setup
- The Raspberry Pi connects to the STM32F030C8 by a STLink-V3MINIE via TagConnect (SWD).
- The pinout is:
  - 1 VCC
  - 2 SWDIO
  - 3 RESET (unused)
  - 4 SWCLK
  - 5 GND
  - 6 Empty
- VTarget of the STLink is shortened to VCC and therefore set to permanent high
- VCC is taken from a pad of the capacitor next to the LDO (3.3V!) 


## Monitoring
- systemctl status prodprog.service
  - To check if service is started
- journalctl -f -u prodprog.service
  - To see console output of service
- prodprog.log contains minimal logging info of production-programming
